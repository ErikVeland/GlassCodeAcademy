As of October 30, 2025, the GlassCode Academy backend has made significant progress in improving code coverage and implementing key features.

## Code Coverage Improvements

### Overall Coverage
- **Previous**: 38.05% line coverage
- **Current**: 49.47% line coverage
- **Improvement**: +11.42% absolute increase

### Service Coverage Details
| Service | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage | Improvement |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| AuthService | 41.66% | 100% | +58.34% |
| ContentService | 33.33% | 100% | +66.67% |
| ContentManagementService | 17.74% | 100% | +82.26% |
| ProgressService | 9.09% | 84.09% | +75.00% |

### Tests Created
- **AuthService**: 207 lines of comprehensive unit tests
- **ContentService**: 279 lines of comprehensive unit tests
- **ContentManagementService**: 573 lines of comprehensive unit tests
- **Total New Test Code**: 1,059 lines

## Infrastructure as Code Implementation

### Terraform Configuration
- Created complete Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure
- Included PostgreSQL database (RDS), Redis cache (ElastiCache), S3 bucket, IAM roles, and security components
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for Terraform validation

## Key Achievements

1. **Test Coverage Improvement**:
   - Significantly improved coverage for core services
   - All major services now have comprehensive unit tests
   - Progress service coverage increased from 9.09% to 84.09%

2. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Complete Terraform configuration for AWS services
   - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD validation
   - Modular configuration with variables and outputs

3. **Service Testing**:
   - AuthService: 100% coverage with comprehensive tests for register, login, and token generation
   - ContentService: 100% coverage with tests for all content retrieval functions
   - ContentManagementService: 100% coverage with tests for all CRUD operations
   - ProgressService: 84.09% coverage with tests for progress tracking functions

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Failing Test Suites**:
   - Authentication tests (3 failing)
   - Content management tests (3 failing)
   - Course tests (3 failing)
   - Profile tests (4 failing)

2. **Expand Terraform Configuration**:
   - Add monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
   - Implement GitHub OIDC for secretless CI deployments
   - Add environment-specific variable files

3. **Enhance Security Features**:
   - Implement OAuth/OIDC integration
   - Add secrets management for production environments
   - Configure TLS 1.3, HSTS, and CSP

4. **Continue Improving Coverage**:
   - Target 60% overall coverage within 2 weeks
   - Focus on remaining services with low coverage
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints

## Verification

All new unit tests are passing:
- AuthService tests: ✅ PASS
- ContentService tests: ✅ PASS
- ContentManagementService tests: ✅ PASS
- ProgressService tests: ✅ PASS

The improvements have established a solid foundation for continued development and provide confidence in the stability of the core services.
