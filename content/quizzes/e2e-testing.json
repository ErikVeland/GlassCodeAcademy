      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The primary purpose of end-to-end testing is to validate complete user workflows from the user interface through all layers of the application to the backend systems. This ensures that integrated functionality works correctly and that different components work together as expected. E2E tests provide confidence that real user scenarios function properly.",
      "industryContext": "E2E testing is critical for continuous deployment pipelines where automated tests must validate that new changes don't break existing functionality. Major companies like Google and Microsoft rely heavily on E2E tests to ensure quality in their web applications. The shift-left testing movement has made E2E testing more important in development workflows.",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Playwright is particularly beneficial when you need cross-browser testing with a unified API that works across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, faster execution through its architecture that runs tests in separate processes, and comprehensive support for modern web features including Shadow DOM, iframes, and web components. Its auto-waiting and retry mechanisms also improve test reliability.",
      "industryContext": "Playwright has gained significant adoption since its release, with companies like Microsoft and Adobe migrating from other frameworks. Its multi-browser support with a single API addresses a major pain point in E2E testing. The framework's performance advantages make it attractive for large test suites where execution time is critical.",
