      "explanation": "The testing pyramid is a conceptual model that guides teams on how to distribute different types of tests. It suggests having many unit tests (fast and cheap), fewer integration tests, and even fewer end-to-end tests (slow and expensive). This distribution optimizes for fast feedback and cost-effectiveness.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,

      "choices": null,
      "explanation": "A stub provides canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. A mock is a stub with added behavior verification - it knows what methods should be called and with what arguments, and can verify this during the test. Use stubs when you need to control indirect inputs, and mocks when you need to verify interactions between objects."

      "explanation": "Test isolation means each test can run independently without being affected by other tests. It's important because it ensures tests are reliable, repeatable, and can be run in any order. You achieve it by using fresh test data for each test, mocking external dependencies, avoiding shared state between tests, and using setup/teardown methods to prepare and clean up the test environment."
