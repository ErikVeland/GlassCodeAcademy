        "`age = 25;`"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "`let` is the correct choice because the user‘s age might change (when they have a birthday), so we need a variable that can be reassigned. `const` is for constants that never change, `var` has scope issues and should be avoided in modern JavaScript, and declaring without a keyword creates a global variable which is dangerous.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The code will output `A`. Since x = 5 and 5 > 3 is true, the first condition is met and `A` is logged. The else if condition (x > 7) is never checked because the first condition was already true. In if-else chains, only the first true condition executes.",

      "explanation": "Option A follows best practices with a descriptive function name, clear parameter names, and returns a value instead of just logging.

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The loop is missing the increment statement `(i++ or i = i + 1)`. Without incrementing `i`, the condition `i < 10` will always be true, creating an infinite loop that will crash the program. The counter variable must be updated inside the loop body.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The function will return `10`. When discountRate is not provided, it uses the default value of 0.1. So 100 * 0.1 = 10. Default parameters allow functions to work even when some arguments are omitted, making them more flexible and user-friendly.",

      "explanation": "A stack data structure is perfect for implementing a function call stack because of its LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior. When functions are called, they are pushed onto the stack, and when they return, they are popped off the stack. This ensures that the most recently called function is the first to return, which is exactly how function calls work.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The primary benefits of functions are code reusability and modularity. Functions allow you to write code once and use it multiple times, reducing duplication.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Accessing an element in an array by index is `O(1)` or constant time complexity. This is because arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, so the memory address of any element can be calculated directly using the base address + (index * element_size) without needing to traverse through other elements.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Declaring a variable without `var`, `let`, or `const` (like `variableName = value;`) creates a global variable, which is generally considered bad practice. Modern JavaScript should use `let` for variables that can change and `const` for constants. The `var` keyword is older and has scope issues, but it‘s still valid.",
