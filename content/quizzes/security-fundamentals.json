      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Balancing security and performance in authentication systems requires using efficient but secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt with appropriate cost factors. Session caching can significantly improve performance by reducing database lookups. The key is finding the right balance between security and user experience.",

        "Use a monolithic approach instead of microservices"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Troubleshooting authorization in microservices requires a systematic approach with distributed tracing to follow requests across services, centralized logging for correlation, and consistent authorization policies.

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "bcrypt with salt and appropriate work factor (cost parameter) is the gold standard for password storage. It's designed to be slow and resistant to rainbow table attacks. AES encryption is reversible (not suitable for passwords), plain text is never acceptable, and MD5 is cryptographically broken and too fast for password hashing.",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries (prepared statements) completely separate SQL code from user data, making SQL injection impossible regardless of input content. Input validation can be bypassed, rate limiting doesn't prevent the vulnerability, and while stored procedures can help, they don't automatically prevent SQL injection if used incorrectly.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The safest and most compliant approach is to never store sensitive card data yourself. Use certified payment processors that handle PCI DSS compliance. This reduces your compliance scope from Level 1 (most stringent) to Level 4 (least stringent) and eliminates the risk of card data breaches from your systems.",
      "industryContext": "PCI DSS compliance is legally required for businesses processing credit cards. Non-compliance can result in fines up to $500,000 per incident, plus liability for fraud losses. Using certified processors is the industry standard approach.",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is in key usage. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Symmetric encryption is generally faster but requires secure key distribution.",

      "explanation": "User awareness training is the most effective security control against social engineering attacks. Since social engineering targets human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, educating users about common tactics like phishing, pretexting, and baiting is the primary defense. Technical controls can help but are secondary to user education.",
