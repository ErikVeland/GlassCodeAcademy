        "Use MD5 hashing for fast password verification"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "bcrypt with salt and appropriate work factor (cost parameter) is the gold standard for password storage. It's designed to be slow and resistant to rainbow table attacks. AES encryption is reversible (not suitable for passwords), plain text is never acceptable, and MD5 is cryptographically broken and too fast for password hashing.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The safest and most compliant approach is to never store sensitive card data yourself. Use certified payment processors that handle PCI DSS compliance. This reduces your compliance scope from Level 1 (most stringent) to Level 4 (least stringent) and eliminates the risk of card data breaches from your systems.",
      "industryContext": "PCI DSS compliance is legally required for businesses processing credit cards. Non-compliance can result in fines up to $500,000 per incident, plus liability for fraud losses. Using certified processors is the industry standard approach.",

      "explanation": "Secure communication requires TLS 1.3 for the latest security features, strong cipher suites to prevent cryptographic attacks, certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, proper certificate validation to ensure authenticity, and HTTPS enforcement to protect all communications.
