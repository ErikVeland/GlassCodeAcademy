      "question": "Which HTML5 element should be used to wrap the main navigation links of a website?",
      "topic": "HTML5",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "<nav>",
        "<div>",
        "<header>",
        "<menu>"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The <nav> element is specifically designed for navigation links. It provides semantic meaning that helps screen readers and search engines understand the purpose of the content. Using <div> provides no semantic value, while <header> is for page headers and <menu> is for interactive commands.",
      "industryContext": "Semantic HTML improves website accessibility for users with disabilities and helps search engines better understand and rank your content.",

      "topic": "CSS3",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "choices": [
        "display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;",

        "display: grid; place-items: center;"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "With Flexbox, 'justify-content: center' centers items horizontally (main axis) and 'align-items: center' centers them vertically (cross axis). Option D would work with CSS Grid, but the question specifically asks about Flexbox.",
      "industryContext": "Flexbox is the most common method for centering content in modern web development, replacing older techniques like floats and positioning.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Both document.getElementById('myId') and document.querySelector('#myId') can select an element by ID. getElementById is the traditional method, while querySelector is more flexible and can use any CSS selector. Option C is incorrect because it should be getElementsByClassName and it's for classes, not IDs.",

      "explanation": "CSS3 layout performance considerations include using Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns) and Grid for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns together). These modern layout systems are optimized by browsers and provide better performance than older techniques like floats. Choosing the right layout method reduces browser reflow and repaint operations.",
      "industryContext": "Browser vendors have heavily optimized Flexbox and Grid implementations. Websites like GitHub and Twitter have seen significant performance improvements by migrating from float-based to modern layout systems.

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Responsive design patterns include a mobile-first approach that starts with small screens and scales up, media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes, flexible units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed pixels, and touch-friendly navigation elements. This approach ensures optimal user experience across all devices while maintaining a single codebase.",
