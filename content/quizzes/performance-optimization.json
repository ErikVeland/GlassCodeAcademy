        "Simple approaches are always superior to complex optimization strategies"
      ],
      "explanation": "Performance optimization trade-offs involve balancing performance gains against increased complexity and maintenance costs. Aggressive optimization techniques can significantly improve performance but may make code harder to understand and maintain. The key is identifying critical performance bottlenecks and applying targeted optimizations where they provide the most benefit relative to their complexity cost.",
      "industryContext": "Performance optimization decisions require careful cost-benefit analysis. Companies like Google and Facebook invest heavily in performance optimization, but they also maintain strict guidelines about when and how to apply optimizations. The principle of 'measure first, optimize second' helps ensure optimizations provide meaningful benefits.",

      "explanation": "Performance optimization should be applied when profiling identifies specific bottlenecks that measurably impact user experience. Premature optimization can lead to unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefits. The approach should be data-driven, focusing on the most critical performance issues first, and validated through measurement to ensure improvements.",
      "industryContext": "The 'premature optimization is the root of all evil' principle from Donald Knuth remains relevant in modern development. Companies use performance budgets and real user monitoring to identify when optimization is needed.

      ],
      "explanation": "Performance optimization trade-offs include client-side optimization that directly improves user experience but can increase code complexity and maintenance burden, versus server-side optimization that's often simpler to implement but may not address all performance bottlenecks. Effective strategies typically combine both approaches, with client-side focusing on user-perceived performance and server-side addressing infrastructure efficiency.",
      "industryContext": "Modern web performance requires holistic optimization strategies that address both client and server concerns.

      "explanation": "Speculative parsing is when browsers parse HTML ahead of time to discover resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets before the main parser reaches them. This allows browsers to start downloading resources earlier. Best practices include writing valid HTML and using resource hints to guide speculative parsing.",
