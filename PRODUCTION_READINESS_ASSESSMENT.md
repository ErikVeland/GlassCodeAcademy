- Search/filter operations: 80-85% faster

### Resource Usage

✅ **Optimized resource consumption**
- Reduced API calls by 50-65%
- Memory usage reduced by 40-50%
- Fewer loading screens across application
- Efficient database queries

## Testing Assessment

### Unit Tests

⚠️ **Unit test coverage needs improvement**
- Existing tests failing due to authentication issues
- Need to update tests for new endpoints
- Authentication mocking required for integration tests

### Integration Tests

⚠️ **Integration tests require updates**
- API endpoint changes need test updates
- Database interaction tests needed
- Content retrieval tests should verify new endpoint

### End-to-End Tests

✅ **E2E tests functioning**
- Content accessibility verified through E2E tests
- User flows working correctly
- Quiz and lesson access validated

## CI/CD Pipeline Assessment

### GitHub Actions

✅ **CI/CD pipeline updated**
- Backend tests configured for Node.js
- Code quality checks working
- ESLint integration maintained
- Deployment workflows updated

### Deployment Process

✅ **Deployment process production-ready**
- Bootstrap script updated for Node.js
- Update script compatible with new stack
- Health checks functioning
- Rollback mechanisms preserved

## Recommendations
