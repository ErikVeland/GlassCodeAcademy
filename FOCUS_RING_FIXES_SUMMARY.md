# Focus Ring Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issue where focus rings were appearing on non-actionable elements (like the entire home page) when clicked.

## Problem
The application was applying focus rings to container elements and non-interactive components due to overly broad CSS selectors, particularly:
- `:focus-within` selectors on glass morphism containers
- Universal `*:focus` selectors in accessibility features

## Changes Made

### 1. `/glasscode/frontend/src/styles/liquid-glass.scss`
- Removed the problematic `.glass-morphism:focus-within` rule that was applying focus styles to all glass containers
- Restructured focus rules to only target actionable elements:
  - `.glass-interactive:focus`
  - `.glass-button:focus`
  - `.glass-filter-tag:focus`
  - `.glass-nav-item:focus`
  - `.glass-search-input:focus`
- Fixed build error by replacing undefined SCSS variables with direct values or CSS custom properties:
  - `$spacing-4` → `1rem`
  - `$spacing-6` → `1.5rem`
  - `$spacing-3` → `0.75rem`
  - `$spacing-2` → `0.5rem`
  - `$border-radius-lg` → `0.75rem`
  - `$color-primary` → `var(--focus-ring)`

### 2. `/glasscode/frontend/src/app/globals.css`
- Removed `.glass-morphism:focus-within` rule
- Added explicit override to ensure no focus styling on glass containers in dark mode

### 3. `/glasscode/frontend/src/styles/design-system/_glassmorphism.scss`
- Replaced the overly broad `.glass-morphism:focus-within` selector
- Updated focus rules to only target specific interactive elements:
  - `.glass-interactive:focus`
  - `.glass-button:focus`
  - `.glass-filter-tag:focus`
  - `.glass-nav-item:focus`
  - `.glass-search-input:focus`

### 4. `/glasscode/frontend/src/styles/responsive.scss`
- Removed `.module-card:focus-within` rule in the `.keyboard-navigation` section
- Removed `.module-card:focus-within` rule in the `.high-contrast` section

### 5. `/glasscode/frontend/src/components/AccessibilityProvider.tsx`
- Fixed the overly broad `.enhanced-focus *:focus` selector
- Restructured to only target actionable elements:
  - `button:focus`
  - `a:focus`
  - `input:focus`
  - `select:focus`
  - `textarea:focus`
  - `[role="button"]:focus`
  - `[tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"]):focus`

## Result
Focus rings now only appear on actionable elements such as:
- Links (`<a>` tags)
- Buttons (including custom button components)
- Form inputs, textareas, and selects
- Elements with explicit roles or tabindex values

Non-actionable elements like the home page container, cards, and panels no longer display focus rings when clicked, improving the user experience while maintaining accessibility compliance.

## Build Error Resolution
The SCSS build error was caused by using undefined SCSS variables (`$spacing-4`, etc.) in the [liquid-glass.scss](file:///Users/veland/GlassCodeAcademy/glasscode/frontend/src/styles/liquid-glass.scss) file. This was resolved by:
1. Replacing SCSS variables with direct CSS values (e.g., `$spacing-4` → `1rem`)
2. Using CSS custom properties where appropriate (e.g., `$color-primary` → `var(--focus-ring)`)

The SCSS now compiles successfully without any undefined variable errors.
