- Created production environment with SSL and monitoring
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Developed rollback procedures for safe deployments

## Verification Results

All requirements have been successfully verified:

✅ **All content migrated**: 18 modules, 100+ lessons, 500+ quiz questions
✅ **All quiz answer types supported**: Multiple-choice, open-ended, fixed order, labeled choices
✅ **Frontend fully functional**: All content displays correctly
✅ **.NET backend completely removed**: No remnants remain
✅ **Node.js backend serving all requests**: API endpoints functional
✅ **Authentication working**: JWT and RBAC properly implemented
✅ **Progress tracking functional**: User progress properly tracked
✅ **Admin content management operational**: Content can be managed through frontend
✅ **CI/CD pipelines updated**: All workflows use Node.js
✅ **Scripts updated**: All deployment and update scripts work with Node.js
✅ **Documentation current**: All docs reflect new technology stack

## Technology Stack

### Current Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with Role-Based Access Control
- **Deployment**: PM2, Nginx, Docker-ready
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Next Steps
