```

### Testing Lesson
```
Automated testing is essential for maintaining code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling confident refactoring in React applications. A comprehensive testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that cover different aspects of your application's functionality.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to write effective unit tests for React components using React Testing Library and Jest. You'll understand how to test component rendering, user interactions, and state changes in isolation.
