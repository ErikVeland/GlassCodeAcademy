# Node Fundamentals Module Enhancement Plan

## Overview
The node-fundamentals.json module contains 15 lessons with placeholder content that needs to be replaced with quality academic content following the design document specifications.

## Enhancement Approach
1. Replace generic template introductions with detailed, 200+ word explanations
2. Enhance code examples with authentic, functional implementations
3. Improve learning objectives to be specific and measurable
4. Add detailed pitfalls and solutions for each lesson
5. Create comprehensive exercises with verification checkpoints
6. Add authoritative sources for each lesson
7. Ensure all content follows academic standards
