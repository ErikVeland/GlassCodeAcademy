      "topic": "Core Web Vitals",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "The time when the browser renders the first piece of DOM content; important for perceived loading speed",

        "The time when the page becomes interactive; important for user experience"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "First Contentful Paint (FCP) measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. It's important because it marks the first visual feedback users receive, which significantly impacts their perception of loading speed.",
      "industryContext": "FCP is one of Google's Core Web Vitals metrics that directly affects search rankings. Websites with good FCP scores (under 1.8 seconds) typically see better user engagement and lower bounce rates.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Priority Hints allow developers to communicate the relative importance of resources to the browser, helping it make better decisions about which resources to load first. This can significantly improve loading performance by ensuring critical resources are loaded before less important ones.",
      "industryContext": "Priority Hints are supported in modern browsers and are part of the Resource Prioritization API. Major websites like Twitter and LinkedIn have seen measurable improvements in loading times by properly implementing resource prioritization.",

      "topic": "Code Splitting",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "Reduces initial bundle size and improves loading time",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Code splitting breaks down large JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This reduces the initial payload that needs to be downloaded and parsed, leading to faster initial page loads and better user experience.",

      "topic": "Script Loading",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "Downloads the script in the background and executes it after HTML parsing is complete",
        "Prevents the script from executing entirely",

        "Caches the script for future page loads"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'defer' attribute tells the browser to download the script in the background while continuing to parse the HTML. The script will execute after the HTML parsing is complete, in the order they appear in the document. This prevents render-blocking and improves page load performance.",
      "industryContext": "Using 'defer' for non-critical scripts is a standard practice in web development. It's particularly important for scripts that need access to the DOM but don't need to run immediately, allowing the page to render faster.",

      "choices": [
        "Reduce file size to decrease loading times and bandwidth usage",
        "Increase image quality for better visual appearance",
        "Encrypt images for security purposes",
        "Convert all images to vector formats"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Image compression reduces the file size of images without significantly compromising quality, which leads to faster loading times and reduced bandwidth consumption. This is crucial because images often make up the largest portion of a webpage's total file size.",

      "topic": "Resource Loading",
      "difficulty": "Beginner",
      "choices": [
        "Loading resources only when they're needed (e.g., when they come into view); useful for images below the fold",
        "Loading all resources at once for faster interaction; useful for small websites",

        "Loading resources twice for redundancy; useful for critical applications"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Lazy loading defers the loading of non-critical resources until they're actually needed, typically when they come into the viewport. This reduces initial page load time and saves bandwidth, especially beneficial for pages with many images or components below the fold.",
      "industryContext": "Lazy loading is supported natively by modern browsers through the 'loading' attribute on images and iframes. It's a key technique for improving Core Web Vitals, particularly LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Browser caching stores copies of resources (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files) locally on the user's device. When the user revisits the site, these cached resources can be loaded instantly instead of being downloaded again, dramatically reducing load times for repeat visits.",
      "industryContext": "Proper caching strategies can reduce server load by up to 80% and improve repeat visit performance significantly. HTTP caching headers like Cache-Control are essential for implementing effective browser caching.",

        "Runtime cost for style generation; potential for style recalculations on component updates",

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "CSS-in-JS libraries have runtime costs for generating and injecting styles, which can impact performance. They may cause style recalculations on component updates and can increase bundle size. However, they offer benefits like dynamic theming and component-scoped styles.",
      "industryContext": "Performance-conscious teams carefully evaluate CSS-in-JS libraries and their runtime costs. Libraries like styled-components have introduced optimizations like static extraction, and some teams prefer zero-runtime alternatives like Linaria or vanilla extract.",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Speculative parsing is when browsers parse HTML ahead of time to discover resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets before the main parser reaches them. This allows browsers to start downloading resources earlier. Best practices include writing valid HTML and using resource hints to guide speculative parsing.",
      "industryContext": "Speculative parsing is implemented in all major browsers and can significantly reduce resource discovery time. Invalid HTML can prevent effective speculative parsing, which is why validation tools like W3C Markup Validator are important for performance optimization.",

      "explanation": "JavaScript bundles must be parsed, compiled, and executed by the browser. Larger bundles take significantly longer to process, especially on mobile devices.
